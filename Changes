    * Muldis::D::Manual version 0.0.0 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-D-Manual-0.0.0.tar.gz.

    * This is the first release of the Muldis-D-Manual distribution, and
    the first release of any distribution to contain Perl 5 modules named
    Muldis::D::Manual::\w+.

    * This is the initial file manifest:

        archives/Muldis_D_PDAFP_200807_lt.xul

    * The file lib/Muldis/D/Manual.pm is the main one that was newly
    created for the Muldis-D-Manual distro, and introduces the distro.

    * All of the 11 files in the archives/ and util/ folders, except the 1
    OSCON2005LightningTalk.txt, have been transferred here from the
    Muldis-D distribution with no significant changes, where they had been
    supplementary files and not part of the language spec proper; so from
    now on, the Muldis-D documentation would just contain the Muldis D spec
    proper and any supplementary material would live in Muldis-D-Manual.
    The 1 was transferred here from the Muldis-Rosetta distribution, where
    it constituted the entire archives/ folder.
